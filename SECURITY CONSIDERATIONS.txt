SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

-Risk assesment:
BT packets might be intercepted and rogue centrals could reissue captured packets causing to block communications from friendly centrals as well as avail of functinalities of changing LEDs and 7seg displays. 
Periphery does not tie into any other systems so this scope is limited by its functinality however future extensions might invalidate this assumption therefore several security implementations are presented.

-Constrains:
BT BLE Module used (HM18) and the solution around the central utilise a one way comm line (central to peripery) which limits means for asymmetric encryption and authentications. 
No feedback from periphery on central's side is expected.

-Meassures:
--MAC address white listing. MAC addresses are stored in a seperate file, stored as HASH and compared against received MAC addresses. 
--Encryption: Costum algorithm based on EXOR with a shared rolling key. 
This still leaves the possibilty of rogue centrals to capture a packet and resend it with a spoofed MAC address.
--Buffer increment check: Each command issued is counted on both side. The counter on each new transmission must have a higher buffer count than stored. 
A received packet with a same buffer count that was received before indicates a rogue transmission attempt and must be dropped. 
Buffer overflow clear procedures might be implemented but requires careful consideration as buffers might be out of sync due to packet losses.
